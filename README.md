# Team Comtress 2

A mod for Team Fortress 2 to fix bugs, improve performance, and add quality of life, with the goal of having those changes pulled upstream by Valve to the modern game. This mod helps us test features, and helps users have an area where they can enjoy the changes and get involved.

We're also experimenting with continuing support work for gameplay balance and other game features. While this is outside of the original scope of the project, we think it's an area we can create value for players of the mod and the community. We won't be submitting these changes to Valve, though they may inform other changes more in line with the original project.

## How can I help?

1. Report bugs you'd like to see fixed in TF2 or TC2 through the issues page.
2. Suggest quality of life improvements (but not balance changes) through the issues page.
3. Install TC2 and play the game to test stability, bug fixes, performance, and enjoyment.

## Installation
